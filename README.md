# Terrarium Temperature & Lighting Controller

Here's a brief description for an Arduino project designed to control temperature and lighting in a terrarium:

This Arduino project automates the management of a terrarium's environment by controlling both temperature and lighting. Using sensors to monitor the temperature, the system adjusts heating or cooling elements to maintain an optimal climate. Additionally, it manages the lighting based on time-of-day or specific light requirements, ensuring plants or animals receive the appropriate amount of light. This setup helps create a stable and healthy environment for your terrarium's inhabitants, making it easier to maintain their well-being with minimal manual intervention.

## Overview

This Arduino project automates the management of a terrarium's environment by controlling temperature and lighting. It is designed to create a stable and healthy environment for plants or animals within the terrarium by using sensors and actuators to maintain optimal conditions.

## Features

- **Temperature Control:** Monitors the terrarium's temperature and adjusts heating or cooling systems to maintain a set temperature range.
- **Lighting Management:** Controls the terrarium lighting based on time-of-day or specific light requirements, ensuring optimal light exposure.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Provides real-time feedback on temperature and lighting conditions.
- **Customizable Settings:** Easily adjust temperature thresholds and lighting schedules to suit different types of terrariums.

## Components

- **Arduino Board:** The main microcontroller that drives the project.
- **Temperature Sensor:** Measures the current temperature within the terrarium.
- **Heating/Cooling System:** Regulates the temperature based on sensor readings.
- **Light Source:** Controlled to provide appropriate lighting conditions.
- **Relay Module:** Interfaces with high-power devices like heating elements and lights.
- **Real-Time Clock (RTC) Module (optional):** Keeps track of time for lighting schedules.
