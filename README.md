# terrarium_control
This Arduino project automates the management of a terrarium's environment by controlling both temperature and lighting. Using sensors to monitor the temperature, the system adjusts heating or cooling elements to maintain an optimal climate. Additionally, it manages the lighting based on time-of-day or specific light requirements
